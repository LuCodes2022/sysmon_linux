# Sysmon For Linux

## Setting Everything UP

### ISO
We first look for the ISO of our choice on our browser of choice, I use google:

After we click on the version of our choice and click download:

### VM

we open our virtual machine of choice, for me that is VirtualBox:

We name our project then choose the ISO we downloaded under the ISO section and select skip unatended installation, then click next:

We select the hardware capabilities needed (note that what I chose here is just general but select yours depending on what is needed to run the ISO of your choice)
